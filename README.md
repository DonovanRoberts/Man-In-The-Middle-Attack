<h1> 👤↔️😈↔️👤 Man In The Middle Attack</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, exploring their dangers, execution methods, and potential risks to individuals and organizations. Using ARP Poisoning as the primary attack method, I demonstrated how a hacker could intercept and manipulate data between endpoints. The project utilized two virtual machines running Kali Linux and Windows 11, with tools like Wireshark and Ettercap to analyze and exploit network vulnerabilities. The research also draws on several published articles, highlighting various MITM techniques such as DNS Spoofing, SSL Hijacking, and Session Hijacking, and the severe risks posed by these attacks, including data theft and unauthorized access.
